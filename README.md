## Technologies and Bounties Applied

To develop our solution, we have integrated the following technologies and bounties:

- **API3 Bounty:** We use API3 to obtain secure and reliable data feeds. API3 provides decentralized oracles that ensure the integrity and accuracy of the data used in our platform.
  
- **Aztec Bounty:** We implement Aztec for handling private transactions with zero-knowledge proofs. Aztec enables confidential transactions, protecting the privacy of the parties involved.
